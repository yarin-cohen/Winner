# Details
* This repository contains a draft solution for predicting results for basketball games based on previous history and players' performances.
* To create relevant data extracted from winner website run `winner_api.py` and `basket_api.py`.
* Running `Basic EDA and preprocessing` notebook will allow you to see detailed data examinations and will create dataframe dictionaries important to running both toy solutions.
* First solution is boosting trees based, second solution tries to represent each player as a neural embedding that will allow us to predict the games' scores. 
* Solution #2 is based on a neural model, defined in `neural_emb_model.py`
